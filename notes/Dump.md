Yes, Oracle GoldenGate can read data from an Oracle database and publish it to Kafka while also replicating it to a MongoDB target in a single read. GoldenGate allows for the configuration of multiple handlers, including Kafka and MongoDB handlers, which can be set up to process and deliver data to their respective targets simultaneously.

For Kafka, the GoldenGate Kafka Handler supports the streaming of data to Kafka topics, handling various formats such as Avro, JSON, and delimited text. The MongoDB Handler, on the other hand, writes data to MongoDB databases using the native Java driver, with various configuration options to manage the write operations efficiently.

The official documentation detailing the capabilities and configurations of these handlers can be found on Oracle's website:

- [Using the MongoDB Handler](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/big-data/19.1/gdbig/mongodb-handler.html)
- [Using the Kafka Handler](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/big-data/19.1/gdbig/kafka-handler.html)

These documents provide detailed instructions on how to configure and deploy handlers for various targets, ensuring that you can achieve concurrent data streaming to both Kafka and MongoDB from a single read operation.
