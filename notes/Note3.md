To assess the load that Oracle GoldenGate downstream integrated capture will put on your production database, several factors must be considered. Here are some key points to evaluate:

### Factors Affecting Load on Production Database

1. **Redo Log Generation Rate**
   - The rate at which redo logs are generated in the production database directly impacts the load. Higher transaction volumes mean more redo data to process.

2. **Redo Log Shipping Configuration**
   - Redo log shipping to the downstream database can create network and I/O load on the production system. The impact depends on the configuration (e.g., synchronous vs. asynchronous shipping).

3. **System Resources**
   - CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth are crucial. The production database should have adequate resources to handle the additional overhead.

4. **GoldenGate Processes**
   - Extract, pump, and other GoldenGate processes will consume CPU and memory. The integrated extract process reads the redo logs, which can add I/O load.

5. **Network Bandwidth**
   - Sufficient network bandwidth is required to transfer redo logs to the downstream database without causing delays.

6. **Capture Process Configuration**
   - The configuration of the integrated capture process, such as the degree of parallelism and SGA size, can impact performance.

### Monitoring and Measuring Load

To measure the actual load:

1. **Database Performance Metrics**
   - Monitor key metrics like CPU usage, I/O wait times, redo log generation rates, and network latency.
   - Use Oracle's Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) and Active Session History (ASH) reports to gather detailed performance data.

2. **GoldenGate Monitoring Tools**
   - Use GoldenGate monitoring tools to check the performance of the extract and pump processes.
   - Monitor the lag between the source and downstream database to ensure it is within acceptable limits.

### Example Monitoring Commands

#### Checking Redo Log Generation Rate
```sql
SELECT
    thread#,
    sequence#,
    bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB",
    first_time,
    next_time
FROM
    v$archived_log
ORDER BY
    first_time DESC;
```

#### Monitoring GoldenGate Extract Process
```sh
GGSCI> INFO EXTRACT extname, DETAIL
```

### Estimating Overhead

#### Simulate Load in a Test Environment
- Set up a test environment that mimics the production database.
- Simulate the transaction load and monitor the impact on system resources.
- Adjust GoldenGate parameters and observe changes in load.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Tune Redo Log Shipping**
   - Use asynchronous redo log shipping to reduce immediate I/O load.

2. **Optimize GoldenGate Configuration**
   - Adjust parameters such as `MAX_SGA_SIZE` and parallelism in the integrated extract to optimize performance.

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Ensure the production database has sufficient CPU, memory, and I/O resources.

4. **Network Optimization**
   - Ensure low latency and sufficient bandwidth for log shipping.

5. **Stagger Log Shipping**
   - Stagger log shipping during off-peak hours if possible to reduce peak load.

### Conclusion

The load on the production database due to GoldenGate downstream integrated capture can vary based on several factors. By monitoring the system and optimizing configurations, you can minimize the performance impact. Setting up a similar load in a test environment will give you a better idea of the actual load and help you make necessary adjustments before applying the setup in production.
